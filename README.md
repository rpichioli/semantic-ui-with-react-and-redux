# semantic-ui-with-react-and-redux
SPA (Single-Page Application) composed by React + Redux + Semantic UI (using official React components).

### Requirements
You must have **npm** in your OS by installing **NodeJS**, easily found at the official website.

The **npm** is used to install the project dependencies and run it by command line.

### Running the React application
First of all you must open your terminal and go to the ```/src/``` where you can see a **package.json**.

Now you need to install the npm dependencies using the command ```npm install```.

Finally you just must enter ```npm start``` to run the React application.

That's all!
